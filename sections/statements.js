// Statements.js

// Definition: A group of words, numbers and operators that perform a specific task. 

// Example:

// a = b * 2;

// Most statements end with a semi-colon but it is not always required or needed. 
// In the example statement "a" and "b" are variables, which are like buckets that can be used to put stuff in,
// variables hold values to be used by the program. They are symbolic placeholders.

// The "2" in the example is a value, refered to as a literal value (it literally means 2).  Literally values
// stand alone without being stored in a variable.

// The "=" and "*" characters are OPERATORS. They perform actions with the values and varibales such as assignment 
// and mathmatic operations.

// Statements are evaluated from the right to the left. The example code tells the computer to get the value stored 
// in variable "b" and multiply it by 2, then store the result back into another variable we call "a".


// The example is not a complete statement as there is no value assigned to "b" thus, the computer cannot
// complete the statement.
