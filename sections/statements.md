## Overview Of Statements

 __Statements:__ a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement. 

 Example of statement in JS:

__a = b * 2;__

The characters a and b are called variables, variables are like boxes you can store stuff in. In programs, variables hold values (like the number 42) to be used by the program. 
Think of them as symbolic placeholders for the values themselves.

The 2 in the example is just a value itself (called a literal value) because it stands alone without being stored in a variable.

The = and * characters are operators they perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication.

Most statements in JavaScript conclude with a semicolon at the end but are not always required.

The statement __a = b * 2;__ tells the computer to get the current value stored in the variable b and multiply that value by 2, then store the result back into another variable we call a.
